# API REST - Using Python

This project was developed in order to provide a starting point for the creation of a REST API with CRUD functionalities.

**Project Features**
- Docker
  - We will use Docker so that our application has a container environment, this way it will be easier to deploy without version or compatibility errors, and it will also allow us to scale our application in a simple and fast way.
- Flask
  - The Flask library will be used in order to create web pages to facilitate the visualization and manipulation of data in a non-systematized way.
- Multiple Integrations
  - We constantly need to access different databases in order to obtain the expected result, for this reason configuration files will be created for different databases.
- Swagger
  - All endpoints created will be mapped and documented through Swagger, in this way the use and maintenance of the API will be facilitated.
